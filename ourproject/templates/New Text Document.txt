I've reviewed the entire solution, and everything appears to be in place. Here's a quick recap of what was done:

Authentication and API Routes:

The app.py file now contains login, registration, logout routes and protected routes for the dashboard and ambulance tracking page.
All API endpoints (verify coverage, submit claim, book appointment, profile update, and Ayushman data integration) are intact.
Dashboard Page (dashboard.html):

The dashboard displays insurance overview with dynamic tabs (including a "Refresh Data" button for the Ayushman Bharat scheme).
Quick actions are available for claim submission, appointment booking, health records, profile update, and a new Ambulance Tracking button linking to the dedicated tracking page.
Recent claims and upcoming appointments are listed.
Ambulance Tracking Page (ambulance_tracking.html):

This page uses Google Maps (with simulation of ambulance movement) to display the real-time tracking.
It also uses Socket.IO to receive live location updates.
The page displays live status (ETA and distance) and driver details.
Static Assets and API Keys:

Make sure to update the placeholder paths for icons (e.g., /user-location.png and /ambulance-icon.png) and insert your actual Google Maps API key in both the dashboard and ambulance tracking page.
Everything is integrated as requested. Let me know if you need any further adj

Summary of the Flow
Registration & Login:
Users register and log in. After login, if the user has not yet submitted a medical profile, they are redirected to the Medical Profile page.

Medical Profile Page:
The user fills out their medical details in medical_profile.html. On submission, the data is stored in the database (linked to the user) and then the user is redirected to the dashboard.

Dashboard:
The dashboard (dashboard.html) now displays the submitted medical profile (if available) and includes quick actions for claims, appointments, health records, profile update, ambulance tracking, and a new Predictive Response link.

Predictive Response Page:
The predictive_response.html page shows dummy emergency response predictions (with a placeholder chart using Chart.js). This page can be further enhanced with real data.

Additional Routes:
The backend is updated to include routes for ambulance tracking and predictive response pages.

Make sure to update the placeholder paths (for icons and Google Maps API key) and customize as needed. This completes the updated flow and templates for your project.ustments or additional features! Summary of What These Scripts Do
File	Purpose
ambulanceService.js	Stores dummy ambulance data, provides a function to fetch available ambulances, and utility functions for distance calculation.
locationSearch.js	Loads Google Maps API, initializes autocomplete for address search, and retrieves user location details.
ambulanceBooking.js	Handles the ambulance booking process - gets nearby ambulances, allows selection, and confirms booking.
ðŸ“Œ How to Integrate These Scripts in HTML
Now, include these scripts in your ambulance_tracking.html file inside the <head> or before the </body> tag:

html
Copy
Edit
<script type="module" src="/static/js/ambulanceService.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="/static/js/locationSearch.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="/static/js/ambulanceBooking.js"></script>
ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
âœ… Copy and paste these files into static/js/ directory in your project.
âœ… Update YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY with your actual Google Maps API key in ambulanceBooking.js.
âœ… Ensure you include these scripts inside ambulance_tracking.html.
âœ… Run your Flask app with:
bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
ðŸš€ Now your ambulance booking system should be fully functional in Vanilla JavaScript + Flask without needing Node.js! ðŸš‘
