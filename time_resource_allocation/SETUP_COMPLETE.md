```

### 2. SQLAlchemy Models Implemented

All required models have been implemented with appropriate fields and relationships:

#### Core Models
1. **User** (`users` table)
   - User authentication and role management
   - Supports both Employee and Manager roles
   - Fields: user_id, username, email, password_hash, role, employee_id, is_active, timestamps
   - Relationship: Links to Employee model

2. **Skill** (`skills` table)
   - Master list of available skills
   - Fields: skill_id, name, category, description, created_at
   - Relationship: One-to-many with EmployeeSkill

3. **EmployeeSkill** (`employee_skills` table)
   - Many-to-many relationship between employees and skills
   - Fields: id, employee_id, skill_id, proficiency_level, years_of_experience, last_used, certified, timestamps
   - Relationships: Links to both Employee and Skill models

4. **Project** (`projects` table)
   - Project management and organization
   - Fields: project_id, name, description, client, status, start_date, end_date, budget, priority, manager_id, timestamps
   - Relationships: Links to Employee (manager), has many Tasks

5. **Task** (`tasks` table) - *Existing, Enhanced*
   - Task definition and requirements
   - Enhanced with project relationship
   - Relationships: Belongs to Project, has many TaskAssignments, ProgressLogs, Timesheets

6. **TaskAssignment** (`task_assignments` table) - *Existing, Renamed from Assignment*
   - Assignment tracking
   - Links tasks to employees with assignment metadata

7. **Timesheet** (`timesheets` table)
   - Time tracking for tasks
   - Fields: timesheet_id, employee_id, task_id, date, hours_worked, description, is_billable, status, approval fields, timestamps
   - Relationships: Links to Employee (worker and approver) and Task

8. **ModelTrainingRow** (`model_training_rows` table)
   - ML training data storage
   - Fields: row_id, employee_id, task_id, assignment_id, features (JSON), label, outcome, metrics, training metadata
   - Relationships: Links to Employee, Task, and TaskAssignment

#### Supporting Models (Pre-existing)
- **Employee** - Enhanced with user relationship
- **ProgressLog** - Progress tracking
- **AnomalyTriage** - Anomaly detection and triage

### 3. Configuration Files

#### extensions.py (New)
Centralizes Flask extension initialization:
- SQLAlchemy (db)
- Flask-Migrate (migrate)

#### config.py (Existing)
Comprehensive configuration management:
- Base Config class
- Environment-specific configs (Development, Production, Testing)
- Database connection settings
- API keys and feature flags

#### __init__.py Files (Updated)
- `models/__init__.py`: Exports all models
- `config/__init__.py`: Exports configuration classes

### 4. Flask Application Integration

#### app.py (Updated)
- Imports db and migrate from extensions
- Initializes database with `db.init_app(app)`
- Initializes migrations with `migrate.init_app(app, db)`
- Imports models to register them with SQLAlchemy
- Application factory pattern maintained

### 5. Flask-Migrate Setup

#### Dependencies
- Added Flask-Migrate==4.0.5 to requirements.txt

#### Migration Files
- `migrations/env.py`: Alembic environment configuration
- `migrations/alembic.ini`: Alembic configuration
- `migrations/script.py.mako`: Migration template
- `migrations/versions/`: Directory for migration scripts

```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   cd time_resource_allocation/backend
   flask db init  # Already done via migrations/ directory
   flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
   flask db upgrade
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Configure DATABASE_URL
   - Set SECRET_KEY

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   ```
